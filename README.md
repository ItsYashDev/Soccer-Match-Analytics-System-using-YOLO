# Soccer-Match-Analytics-System-using-YOLO
This project is an AI-powered real-time soccer analytics system that automatically tracks players, referees, and the ball in a football match video. Built using the YOLO object detection model, the system performs player team classification, speed estimation, and ball tracking, and displays all results through an interactive Streamlit dashboard.
